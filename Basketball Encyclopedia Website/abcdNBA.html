          The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North
          America; composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is widely considered
          to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. The NBA is an active member
          of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International
          Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States.
          The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
          NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.
          <br/>
          The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of
          America (BAA). The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3,
          1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several
          international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located
          in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios
          are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.
          <br/>
          The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions,
          reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home
          to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.
          <br/>
          The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three
          divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in
          the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and
          Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams
          are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in
          the Pacific.
          <br/>
          Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training
          camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the
          team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season,
          and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they
          will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less
          than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of
          preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA
          cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the
          last week of October.
          <br/>
          During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team
          faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays
          six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games),
          and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the
          teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure
          means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as
          the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their
          division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games
          against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home,
          9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each
          team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).
          <br/>
          The NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the
          United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular
          season (the other being the National Hockey League). Each team hosts and visits
          every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the
          distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams
          play every other team.
          <br/>
          The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.
          The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[50] though
          the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983–84. Games played on
          this day have featured some of the best teams and players. Christmas is
          also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air
          on network television each season. Games played on this day have been some
          of the highest-rated games during a particular season.
          <br/>
          In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game.
          Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top
          vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of
          the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the
          top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars.
          The top vote-getter in the league eanrs first pick and so forth. The player with the
          best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions
          of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge),
          where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball
          game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the
          world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course
          consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point
          Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals
          in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball
          in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have
          varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming
          rights.
          <br/>
          Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th
          Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time. After this date,
          teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season,
          although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right
          before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.
          <br/>
          Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting
          begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide,
          post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming
          off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started).
          The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player.
          The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown
          the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award
          is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to
          the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player
          Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season.
          Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of
          the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for
          the benefit of his franchise.
          <br/>
          The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie
          Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the
          top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are
          two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also
          two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.

    <h2>About US</h2>
    <p>After years in the industry, we realized that it was near impossible for the people to get all the information about basketball in a single website. Traditional basketball websites were simply too complicated, time consuming, and complex to handle.
       <br/><br/>
       We created the "Basketball Encyclopedia" with the user's perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would provide every detail about basketball. We keep it simple, so users can gather knowledge easily. Best of all - it's free.
       <br/><br/>
       After seeing an increased interest of people in basketball, we developed one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online website, allowing people to become aware of happenings in basketball.
       <br/><br/>
       Today, we're proud to provide free knowledge to everyone.
