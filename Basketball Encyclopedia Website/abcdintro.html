        <p>
          Basketball is a team sport in which ten players, five on a side, opposing one another on
          a rectangular court, have in play the primary objective to shoot a basketball (approximately
          9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in
          diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while
          preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two
          points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul,
          timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one
          or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but
          if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
          <br/>
          Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it
          to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety
          of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler,
          intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a
          missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot
          without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
          <br/>
          The five players on a each side at a time fall into five positions player positions: the tallest
          player is usually the center, the tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter
          but more agile big man is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers
          are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the
          execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play
          0three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
          <br/>
          Invented in 1891 by Canadian—American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts,
          basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The
          National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in
          the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.[2][3] Outside North
          America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the
          Euroleague and FIBA Americas League. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball
          Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from
          around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket
          and FIBA AmeriCup.
          <br/>
          The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top
          national teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA
          (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas strongest European
          clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.

        <p>
          In early December 1891, Canadian Dr. James Naismith, a physical education professor and
          instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA)
          (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class
          active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at
          proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as
          either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed
          a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets,
          this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket"
          or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed,
          allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.
          <br/>
          Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football"
          were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable
          bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.
          These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free
          ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith.
          (Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and
          remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only
          in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and
          spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of
          the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means
          of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early
          balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s[citation needed], as
          manufacturing improved the ball shape.
          <br/>
          The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with
          backboards.A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a
          person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most
          points won the game. The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the
          playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere
          with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional
          effect of allowing rebound shots. Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter
          in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated
          rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.
          <br/>
          Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas
          break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't
          thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started. Mahan suggested that it be
          called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game. Mahan
          then said, "Why not call it basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems
          to me that would be a good name for it."[12][13] The first official game was played in the YMCA
          gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the
          shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or
          National Basketball Association (NBA) court.
          <br/>
          At the time, football was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter
          weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them
          split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

          The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the
          opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own.
          An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points,
          or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in)
          from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games.
          A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.

    <h2>About US</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">After years in the industry, we realized that it was near impossible for the people to get all the information about basketball in a single website. Traditional basketball websites were simply too complicated, time consuming, and complex to handle.
       <br/><br/>
       We created the "Basketball Encyclopedia" with the user's perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would provide every detail about basketball. We keep it simple, so users can gather knowledge easily. Best of all - it's free.
       <br/><br/>
       After seeing an increased interest of people in basketball, we developed one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online website, allowing people to become aware of happenings in basketball.
       <br/><br/>
       Today, we're proud to provide free knowledge to everyone.
