              Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ,
              is an American former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the
              National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards.
              His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is
              the greatest basketball player of all time."Jordan was one of the most effectively
              marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing
              the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. He is currently the principal
              owner and chairman of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets.
              <br/>
              Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina.
              As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.
              Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as
              a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability,
              demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests,
              earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for
              being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA
              championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993,
              securing a "three-peat". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the
              beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season and started a new career playing minor league baseball,
              he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996,
              1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.
              Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from
              2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.
              <br/>
              Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable
              Player (MVP) Awards, ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five MVP Awards, ten
              All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA
              All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, three steals titles, and
              the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for highest
              career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career
              playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest
              North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the
              Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into
              the Basketball Hall of Fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career,
              and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men's Olympic
              basketball team ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.
              <br/>
              Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air
              Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today. Jordan also
              starred as himself in the 1996 film Space Jam. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of
              basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats; he bought a controlling interest in 2010.
              In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. He is the third-richest
              African-American, behind Robert F. Smith and Oprah Winfrey.

              William Felton Russell (born February 12, 1934) is an American retired professional
              basketball player. Russell played center for the Boston Celtics of the National
              Basketball Association (NBA) from 1956 to 1969. A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player
              and a twelve-time All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty, winning
              eleven NBA championships during his thirteen-year career. Russell tied the record for
              the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league (with Henri
              Richard of the National Hockey League). Before his professional career, Russell led
              the University of San Francisco to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,
              and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer
              Olympics.
              <br/>
              Russell is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history.
              He was 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan. His shot-blocking
              and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics' domination of the NBA during
              his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities. He led the NBA in
              rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds, and
              remains second all-time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just
              two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more
              than 50 rebounds in a game. Russell was never the focal point of the Celtics' offense,
              but he did score 14,522 career points and provided effective passing.
              <br/>
              Russell played in the wake of black pioneers like Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and
              Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status
              in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the
              Celtics, becoming the first black coach in North American professional sports and
              the first to win a championship. In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential
              Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the Civil Rights Movement.
              <br/>
              Russell is one of seven players in history to win an NCAA Championship, an NBA
              Championship, and an Olympic gold medal. He was inducted into the Naismith
              Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of
              Fame. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th
              Anniversary Team in 1980, and named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA
              History in 1996, one of only four players to receive all three honors. In 2007,
              he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. In Russell's honor the NBA renamed the
              NBA Finals Most Valuable Player trophy in 2009: it is now the Bill Russell NBA
              Finals Most Valuable Player Award

              Larry Joe Bird (born December 7, 1956) is an American professional basketball executive,
              former coach and former player, most recently serving as president of the Indiana Pacers
              in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Since retiring as a player for the Boston
              Celtics, he was a mainstay in the Indiana Pacers organization, but stepped down from the
              position of president following the first round of the 2017 Eastern Conference playoffs.
              He has been described as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
              <br/>
              Drafted into the NBA sixth overall by the Boston Celtics in 1978, Bird started at small
              forward and power forward for thirteen seasons, spearheading one of the NBA's most
              formidable frontcourts that included center Robert Parish and power forward Kevin McHale.
              Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star and was named the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP)
              three consecutive times (1984–1986). He played his entire professional career for Boston,
              winning three NBA championships and two NBA Finals MVP awards.
              <br/>
              He was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team")
              that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Bird was voted to the NBA's 50th
              Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996 and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball
              Hall of Fame in 1998 (and was inducted again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team").
              <br/>
              He served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. In 2003, he assumed
              the role of President of Basketball Operations for the Pacers, holding the position
              until retiring in 2012. After a year away from the position, he announced he would
              return to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013. In addition
              to being part of the 50–40–90 club, he is the only person in NBA history to be named
              Rookie of the Year, Regular Season MVP, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year,
              and Executive of the Year.

              <br/>
              Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.; April 16, 1947) is an
              American retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National
              Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers.
              During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable
              Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an
              11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a
              player and two as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP.
              In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach
              Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and Julius Erving have called him the greatest
              basketball player of all time.
              <br/>
              After winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City,
              Alcindor was recruited by Jerry Norman, the assistant coach of UCLA, where he played
              for coach John Wooden on three consecutive national championship teams and was a record
              three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted in the first overall pick by the one-
              season-d Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee.
              After winning his first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name
              Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark "skyhook" shot, he established himself as one
              of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played
              the last 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul
              Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the "Showtime" era of Lakers basketball.
              Over his 20-year NBA career, his team succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and past
              the 1st round in 14 of them; his team reached the NBA Finals 10 times.
              <br/>
              At the time of his retirement in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points
              scored (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes played (57,446), field goals made (15,837),
              field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), career
              wins (1,074), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leader in points scored
              and career wins. He is ranked third all-time in both rebounds and blocked shots. In 2007,
              ESPN voted him the greatest center of all time, in 2008, they named him the "greatest
              player in college basketball history", and in 2016, they named him the second best player
              in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan). Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball
              coach, and a best-selling author. In 2012, he was selected by Secretary of State Hillary
              Clinton to be a U.S. global cultural ambassador. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded
              him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

              championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after
              announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game,
              winning the All-Star MVP Award. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again
              for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before
              retiring for the third and final time.
              <br/>
              Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances,
              twelve All-Star games, and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations. He led the league
              in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists
              per game, at (11.2). Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball
              team ("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in
              1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that travelled around
              the world playing exhibition games. Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players
              in NBA History in 1996.
              <br/>
              Johnson became a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame—being enshrined in
              2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team". He was
              rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007.[4] His friendship and
              rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and
              three NBA championship series, are well documented.

              Wilton Norman Chamberlain (August 21, 1936 – October 12, 1999) was an American
              basketball player. He played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the
              Philadelphia 76ers, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association
              (NBA). He played for the University of Kansas and also for the Harlem Globetrotters
              before playing in the NBA. The 7 foot 1 inch, Chamberlain weighed 250 pounds as a
              rookie before bulking up to 275 and eventually to over 300 pounds with the Lakers
              and played the center position. He is widely considered one of the greatest and most
              dominant players in NBA history.
              <br/>
              Chamberlain holds numerous NBA records in scoring, rebounding, and durability
              categories. He is the only player to score 100 points in a single NBA game or
              average more than 40 and 50 points in a season. He also won seven scoring, eleven
              rebounding, nine field goal percentage titles and led the league in assists once.
              Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average at least 30 points and 20
              rebounds per game in a season, which he accomplished seven times. He is also the only
              player to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game over the entire course
              of his NBA career. Although he suffered a long string of professional losses,
              Chamberlain had a successful career, winning two NBA championships, earning four
              regular-season Most Valuable Player awards, the Rookie of the Year award, one NBA
              Finals MVP award, and being selected to 13 All-Star Games and ten All-NBA First and
              Second teams.[2][5] He was subsequently enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball
              Hall of Fame in 1978, elected into the NBA's 35th Anniversary Team of 1980, and chosen
              as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History of 1996.

              Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal (born March 6, 1972), nicknamed "Shaq", is an American
              retired professional basketball player currently serving as a sports analyst on
              the television program Inside the NBA. He is widely considered one of the greatest
              players in NBA history. At 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall[4] and 330 pounds (150 kg),
              he was one of the tallest and heaviest men ever to play in the NBA, where he
              played for six teams throughout his 19-year career.
              <br/>
              Following his time at Louisiana State University, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando
              Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of
              the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading
              his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as
              a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships
              in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was
              traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006.
              Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a
              season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in
              the 2009–10 season. O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season
              before retiring.
              <br/>
              O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 MVP award, the 1992–93 NBA
              Rookie of the Year award, 15 All-Star game selections, three All-Star Game MVP
              awards, three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections,
              and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to
              win NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000);
              the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998.
              He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds,
              and 8th in blocks. Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball, O'Neal also
              ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%). O'Neal was elected into
              the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. He was elected to the
              FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.

              Kobe Bean Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is an American former professional
              basketball player. He played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles
              Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He entered the NBA directly
              from high school and won five NBA championships with the Lakers. Bryant is an
              18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of
              the All-Defensive team. He led the NBA in scoring during two seasons and ranks
              third on the league's all-time regular season scoring and fourth on the all-time
              postseason scoring list. He holds the NBA record for the most seasons playing
              with one franchise for an entire career and is widely regarded as one of the
              greatest basketball players of all time. Bryant is the first guard in NBA
              history to play for at least 20 seasons.
              <br/>
              The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, Kobe Bryant enjoyed a successful
              high school basketball career at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania,
              where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country.
              He declared for the NBA draft upon graduation and was selected in the 13th overall
              pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, who traded him to the Lakers.
              As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite
              by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second
              season. Despite a feud between them, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers to
              three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002.
              <br/>
              In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault in Colorado, but the charges were
              eventually dropped, and a civil suit was settled out of court. After the Lakers
              lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became the
              cornerstone of the Lakers, and he led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and
              2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto
              Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in league history behind
              Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant was awarded the regular season's
              Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the 2008 NBA Finals,
              he led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, earning the
              Finals MVP Award on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in
              the league through 2013 when the 34-year-old Bryant suffered a torn Achilles
              tendon. Although he recovered, his play was limited the following two years by
              season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively. Citing his physical
              decline, he announced that he would retire after the 2015–16 season.

              Timothy Theodore Duncan (born April 25, 1976) is an American retired professional
              basketball player. He played his entire 19-year career with the San Antonio Spurs

              of all time.
              <br/>
              Duncan started out as a swimmer and only began playing basketball in ninth grade

              and had a college career with the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, winning the Naismith
              College Player of the Year, USBWA College Player of the Year, and John Wooden
              awards in his senior year. After graduating, Duncan earned NBA Rookie of the Year
              honors after being selected by San Antonio with the first overall pick in the 1997
              NBA draft.
              <br/>

              <br/>
              LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984) is an American professional
              basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball
              Association (NBA). Often considered the best basketball player in the world
              and regarded by some as the greatest player of all time, James' NBA accomplishments
              are extensive, and include four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals
              MVP Awards, two Olympic gold medals, three All-Star Game MVP awards, an NBA
              scoring title, and is the all-time NBA playoffs scoring leader. He has also
              amassed fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, twelve All-NBA First Team
              designations, and five All-Defensive First Team honors.
              <br/>
              A prep-to-pro, James played high school basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High
              School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted in the national
              media as a future NBA superstar. He joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 as the
              first overall draft pick. James quickly emerged as a league star and concluded his
              first season by winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He would go on to
              stablish himself as one of the premier players in the NBA with multiple accolades,
              including being given the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2009 and 2010. However,
              after falling short of the championship expectations set by the media, fans, and
              himself, James departed Cleveland in 2010 as a free agent to sign with the Miami
              Heat. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one
              of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history.
              <br/>
              In Miami, James won his first NBA championship in 2012, and followed that with
              another title a year later. He was named league MVP and NBA Finals MVP in both
              championship years. In 2014, James opted out of his contract with Miami after
              four seasons to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, James led the Cavaliers to
              their first NBA championship by defeating the Golden State Warriors to end
              Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought. In 2018, he opted out
              of his Cleveland contract to sign with the Lakers.
